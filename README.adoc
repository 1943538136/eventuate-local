= Eventuate Local

== Simplifying the development of transactional microservices

Eventuate&trade; Local is the on-premise, open source version of http://eventuate.io/[Eventuate&trade;], which is a platform for developing transactional business applications that use the microservice architecture.
Eventuate provides an event-driven programming model for microservices that is based on event sourcing and CQRS.
Eventuate&trade; Local has the same API as the SaaS version but uses a SQL database to persist events and Kafka as the publish/subscribe mechanism.

Eventuate Local consists of:

* A framework for developing (microservice-based) applications.
* An event store consisting of a SQL database (currently MySQL) and Kafka.

The framework persists events in an `EVENTS` table in the SQL database and subscribes to events in Kafka.
A change data capture component  tails the database transaction log and publishes each event to Kafka.
There is a Kafka topic for each aggregate type.

= About change data capture

Eventuate Local has a change data capture (CDC) component  that

1. tails the MySQL transaction log
2. publishes each event inserted into the `EVENTS` table to Kafka topic for the event's aggregate.

The CDC component runs within each application.

= Setting up Eventuate Local

To use Eventuate Local you need to

1. Create `EVENT` and `ENTITIES`'` tables in a MySQL database.
2. Run Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka

The easiest way to get started is to run a set of Docker containers using Docker Compose.

== The quick version

Run the following commands:

```
./scripts/initialize.sh
```

Read on for the longer version.

== Set some environment variables

Please review the file `./scripts/set-env.sh` and run

```
. ./scripts/set-env.sh
```

== Run the Docker containers

The `docker-compose.yml` defines a set of Docker containers:

* zookeeper - used by both the change data capture component and Kafka
* kafka - message broker
* mysql - MySQL database

Create these containers using the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

== Create the database schema

Run this command:
```
./scripts/create-mysql-database.sh
```

This creates a MySQL database called `eventuate` and the necessary tables.

At this point Eventuate Local is ready.

= Running an example application

We are currently enhancing http://eventuate.io/exampleapps.html[the example applications] to support both Eventuate and Eventuate Local.
Currently, the `wip-eventuate-local` branch of https://github.com/cer/event-sourcing-examples/tree/wip-eventuate-local[Event Sourcing Examples] supports Eventuate Local.
To build and run with Eventuate Local, use `./gradlew -P eventuateLocal ...`.

= Developing an application

For more information about developing applications with Eventuate Local see the http://eventuate.io/gettingstartedv2.html[Getting Started guide].

== Note

Please specify the following in `gradle.properties`:

```
eventuateLocalVersion=0.2.0.RELEASE
```

and instead of the HTTP/STOMP dependency, specify the following:

```
compile "io.eventuate.local.java:eventuate-local-java-jdbc:${eventuateLocalVersion}"
compile "io.eventuate.local.java:eventuate-local-java-embedded-cdc-autoconfigure:${eventuateLocalVersion}"
```
